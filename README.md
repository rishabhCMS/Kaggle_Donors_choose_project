## Aim of the project
DonorsChoose.org is an online charity that makes it easy to help students in need through school donations. 
At any time, thousands of teachers in K-12 schools propose projects requesting materials to enhance the education of their students. 
When a project reaches its funding goal, they ship the materials to the school. 

The aim of this project is to identify projects that are exceptionally exciting to the business, at the time of posting. 
While all projects on the site fulfill some kind of need, certain projects have a quality above and beyond what is typical. 
By identifying and recommending such projects early, they will improve funding outcomes, better the user experience, 
and help more students receive the materials they need to learn.
